Here's a complete breakdown of all your questions about Garbage Collection (GC) in .NET, with clear explanations and examples:

---

### **1. Explain Garbage Collector (GC)?**

GC is a .NET runtime feature that automatically frees memory occupied by objects no longer in use.

**Example**:

```csharp
MyClass obj = new MyClass();
obj = null; // Eligible for GC
```

Once `obj` is set to `null`, it's no longer referenced and can be cleaned by GC.

---

### **2. How does GC know when to clean the objects?**

GC tracks object references. When no references to an object remain, it's marked as "unreachable" and eligible for cleanup.

---

### **3. Is there a way we can see this Heap memory?**

Yes, tools like:

* **dotMemory**
* **Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools**
* **PerfView**

These allow you to inspect heap usage and track allocations.

---

### **4. Does GC clean primitive types?**

No, primitive types like `int`, `bool` stored on the stack aren't garbage collected. Only objects on the heap are managed by GC.

---

### **5. Managed vs Unmanaged code/objects/resources?**

* **Managed**: Controlled by .NET GC (e.g., strings, classes).
* **Unmanaged**: Outside .NET control (e.g., file handles, database connections).

---

### **6. Can GC clean unmanaged code?**

No. GC doesn’t clean unmanaged resources. You must explicitly release them using `Dispose()` or `Finalize()`.

---

### **7. Explain Generations?**

Generations are memory segments:

* **Gen 0**: Short-lived objects (e.g., local variables).
* **Gen 1**: Medium lifespan objects.
* **Gen 2**: Long-lived objects (e.g., static data).

---

### **8. What is GC0, GC1, and GC2?**

These are garbage collections for different generations:

* **GC0**: Fastest, for Gen 0.
* **GC1**: For Gen 1.
* **GC2**: Full GC for Gen 2. Slower.

---

### **9. Why do we need Generations?**

It improves performance. Most objects die young, so GC can quickly clean Gen 0 without scanning the entire heap.

---

### **10. Which is the best place to clean unmanaged objects?**

In the `Dispose()` method or using the `using` statement.

---

### **11. How does GC behave when we have a destructor?**

GC will call the destructor (`~ClassName`) via Finalizer, but it's non-deterministic and may delay cleanup.

---

### **12. What do you think about empty destructor?**

Bad practice. It unnecessarily puts the object in the finalization queue and slows down GC.

---

### **13. Explain the Dispose Pattern?**

Used to free unmanaged resources. Implements `IDisposable`.

**Example**:

```csharp
public class MyResource : IDisposable
{
    private bool disposed = false;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this); // Prevents finalizer from running
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Free managed resources
            }
            // Free unmanaged resources
            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    ~MyResource()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }
}
```

---

### **14. Finalize vs Destructor?**

They’re the same in C#. The destructor syntax (`~ClassName`) is compiled to a `Finalize()` method.

---

### **15. What is the use of `using` keyword?**

Ensures deterministic disposal of resources.

**Example**:

```csharp
using (var reader = new StreamReader("file.txt"))
{
    // reader is disposed at the end of the block
}
```

---

### **16. Can you force Garbage Collector?**

Yes, using `GC.Collect();`

---

### **17. Is it a good practice to force GC?**

No. It interrupts normal execution and may degrade performance.

---

### **18. How can we detect memory issues?**

* Monitor memory usage in **Task Manager**
* Use **Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools**
* Use **dotMemory**, **PerfView**, or **CLR Profiler**

---

### **19. How can we know the exact source of memory issues?**

* Memory profilers show object allocation and retention paths.
* Analyze **GC dumps**, **heap snapshots**, and **leak suspects**.

---

### **20. What is a memory leak?**

When memory that is no longer needed is not released due to lingering references.

---

### **21. Can .NET Application have memory leak as we have GC?**

Yes. GC cannot collect objects still referenced, even if they're no longer used logically.

---

### **22. How to detect memory leaks in .NET applications?**

* Use profilers (dotMemory, ANTS)
* Analyze object lifetimes
* Monitor for continuously growing memory usage

---

### **23. Explain weak and strong references?**

* **Strong reference**: Prevents object from being garbage collected.
* **Weak reference**: Allows object to be collected.

**Example**:

```csharp
WeakReference<MyClass> weakRef = new WeakReference<MyClass>(new MyClass());
```

---

### **24. When will you use weak references?**

* Caching scenarios
* Large objects that can be reloaded
* Observers or event handlers to avoid memory leaks
